# emotion_detection_demo1
A demo to show building emotion detection app by leverage Keras and Tensorflow

My first trial on Deep Learning, with steps:
1.Train a emotion detection model from Fer2013 dataset.
2.Develop an API so that the other applications can call it.
3.Develop some demo pages to show how to use the API.
